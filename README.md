You have learned about basic concepts of software testing, modularity, version control and ethics in the second half of this unit. You learned how to use a version control system to maintain your code and other files. You have learned how to design test cases using black-box and white-box testing approaches, implement test designs as a test code and run them to test your code. You have learned about several concepts related to designing better, more modular code. You were introduced to ethical and professional issues in software engineering and ways to reduce them. This assessment evaluates your competency in above areas of Software Engineering. It expects you to apply the knowledge you have gained via lectures, practical classes and sign-offs to design and implement simple software following modularity principles, verify your code against a review checklist, design test cases and test the code you have developed. Finally, you will explore ethical and professionalism issues and ways to avoid them in your software system. You will use a version control system to keep track of all the activities of the whole assessment task. You will document your work in each stage so that another person can understand the work you have done.
